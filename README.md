Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to 
have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from 
streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the 
Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its 
existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in 
order to stay competitive. To help with the launch strategy for the 
new online video service, various questions need to be answered 
and results presented to the management.
